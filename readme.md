# React Native To-Do App

A simple **To-Do application** built with **React Native**, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) design principle**.
This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to structure and develop a small-scale React Native app.

---

##  Features

* Add, view, and manage tasks
* Clean and minimal UI
* Built with **Expo** for easy setup and testing
* Structured with **MVC design** for better scalability and maintainability

---

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally:

```bash
# 1. Install Expo (latest version)
npx expo install expo@latest

# 2. Fix dependencies if needed
npx expo install --fix

# 3. Start the development server
npx expo start
# or use tunnel mode if needed
npx expo start --tunnel
```

---

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ models/      # Handles data and business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ views/       # UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/ # Connects models and views
â””â”€â”€ App.js       # Entry point of the app
```

##  Why MVC?

Using the **MVC architecture** makes the app easier to:

* Maintain and extend
* Separate concerns (UI, logic, and data)
* Provide a clear structure for learning and scaling

---

## Requirements

* Node.js (LTS recommended)
* Expo CLI
* React Native environment set up

Would you like me to also create a **screenshot/demo section** (with placeholder images or GIFs) so the README looks even more engaging on GitHub?
